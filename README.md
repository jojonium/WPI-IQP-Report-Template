# WPI IQP Report Template

This is a simple LaTeX template for writing a WPI IQP report paper. The style is
based on [WPI's IQP writing guidelines](https://www.wpi.edu/sites/default/files/IQP_Writing_Guidelines.pdf).

Because IQP proposals and final reports are slightly different, I have chosen to
include a template for each, found in their respective folders.

If you have `latexmk` you can compile the document with the command 
`latexmk -pdf -bibtex proposal`.

Comments and suggestions welcome! Just raise an issue on the GitHub page.

Basically you can do whatever you want with this template for whatever purpose
you want, and you don't have to cite me.
